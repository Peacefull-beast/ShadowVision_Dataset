**Title: ShadowVision Dataset: Illuminating Deep Learning in Low-Light Environments**

**Abstract:**

In the quest to improve the robustness and accuracy of deep learning models for computer vision tasks, the creation of specialized datasets plays a pivotal role. One such dataset, the "ShadowVision Dataset," has been meticulously crafted to address a critical challengeâ€”enhancing the performance of deep learning models in low-light environments. This dataset aims to shed light on the dark corners of computer vision, literally and figuratively, by offering a unique collection of synthetic dark videos derived from normal videos.

**Introduction:**

Low-light environments have long been the nemesis of computer vision algorithms, posing significant challenges to accurate object detection, recognition, and tracking. The ShadowVision Dataset was conceived as a remedy to this problem. Leveraging synthetic video generation techniques, we have meticulously crafted a comprehensive dataset that empowers deep learning models to excel even in the most challenging lighting conditions.

**Dataset Creation:**

The creation of the ShadowVision Dataset involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection:** We start by collecting a diverse set of normal videos, covering a wide range of scenarios and objects. These videos serve as the basis for generating the synthetic dark videos.

2. **Synthetic Dark Video Generation:** Using advanced techniques, we simulate low-light conditions by manipulating pixel intensities and introducing shadows. This process creates a counterpart for each normal video in our dataset.

3. **Labeling:** Ground truth annotations are provided for both normal and synthetic dark videos, ensuring that our dataset is suitable for various computer vision tasks, including object detection, recognition, and tracking.

**Dataset Statistics:**

The ShadowVision Dataset boasts the following statistics:

- **Annotations:** Vedios are named with it labels and a label file is also provided for no more hassle.
- **Scale:** With thousands of videos, the dataset provides a rich source of training and evaluation data.

**Deep Learning Models:**

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the ShadowVision Dataset, we have trained several deep learning models on this data. These models encompass state-of-the-art architectures, and their performance metrics are impressive:

- **Top-1 Accuracy:** Achieving high top-1 accuracy rates, our models demonstrate their ability to correctly classify objects even in challenging low-light scenarios.
- **Top-5 Accuracy:** The top-5 accuracy rates further underscore the robustness of our models, showcasing their capacity to handle complex scenes.


**Applications:**

The ShadowVision Dataset has a broad range of applications, including:

1. **Surveillance:** Improved object detection and tracking in low-light surveillance scenarios.
2. **Autonomous Vehicles:** Enhanced perception systems for self-driving cars in nighttime conditions.
3. **Security:** Improved security camera systems for dark environments.
4. **Entertainment:** Enhanced video quality in film and television production.

**Conclusion:**

The ShadowVision Dataset represents a significant milestone in addressing the challenges of low-light computer vision. By offering a rich source of synthetic dark videos paired with normal videos, accompanied by annotations, it empowers deep learning models to excel in low-light environments. The dataset is a testament to the transformative potential of synthetic data generation in advancing computer vision, paving the way for safer, more efficient, and more accurate visual recognition systems in challenging lighting conditions.
